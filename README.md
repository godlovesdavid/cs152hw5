hey guys I just went ahead and finished the whole project.
please still look over the code so that we can get hw6 done easier. That
one will definitely take some time to complete. I updated the UML
diagram in my google drive folder
https://drive.google.com/#folders/0BxKntDr77oW8X2VwamlteUlpR0E. If we
all understand the code it will be much easier to finish the next hw.
There's actually some bugs that i don't know how to fix yet, but at
least it works for the input file he gave us.
