Hey guys,

I just went ahead and finished the whole project.
Please still look over the code so that we can get the next homework done easier, by understanding the code. That
one will definitely take some time to complete. I updated the UML
diagram https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxKntDr77oW8Z05wOUNVVzFkY28/edit.

There's actually some bugs that I don't know how to fix yet, but at
least it works for the input file he gave us.
